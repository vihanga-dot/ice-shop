ICE SHOP GOOGLE SHEETS INTEGRATION - CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST

Before your order system will work with Google Sheets, you must complete these steps:

□ 1. Create a Google Sheet with the required column headers:
   - Order ID, Customer ID, Customer Name, Customer Email, 
   - Customer Phone, Customer Address, Delivery Type, 
   - Items, Total, Order Date, Status

□ 2. Note your Google Sheet ID from the URL:
   - URL format: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[YOUR_SHEET_ID]/edit
   - Example: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz/edit
   - Your Sheet ID: 1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz

□ 3. Create a Google Apps Script project at: https://script.google.com

□ 4. In the Apps Script editor:
   - Delete default code
   - Paste the code from GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.txt
   - Replace 'YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE' with your actual Sheet ID (do this twice in the file)

□ 5. Deploy the Apps Script:
   - Click "Deploy" > "New deployment"
   - Choose "Web app" as the type
   - Set "Execute as" to "Me"
   - Set "Who has access" to "Anyone" (or "Anyone with Google account" for security)
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Copy the provided "Execution URL"

□ 6. Update your website:
   - Open script.js in your ice_shop folder
   - Find: const GOOGLE_SHEETS_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE';
   - Replace 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE' with your Execution URL
   - Save the file

□ 7. Test the system:
   - Place a test order through your website
   - Check if it appears in your Google Sheet
   - Log into admin panel (password: scoopadmin123)
   - Verify orders display in the admin panel
   - Test updating an order status to "completed"

□ 8. Security considerations:
   - Consider restricting script access to "Anyone with Google account" instead of "Anyone"
   - Be aware of Google Apps Script quotas and limits
   - Monitor script execution logs for any issues

□ 9. Optional: Run the setupHeaders() function in Apps Script to ensure proper headers exist

Troubleshooting Checklist:
□ Are the headers in your Google Sheet exactly as specified?
□ Is your Sheet ID correctly entered in the Apps Script?
□ Is your Execution URL correctly entered in script.js?
□ Are there any browser console errors during order placement?
□ Are there any execution errors in the Apps Script dashboard?

Once all these steps are completed, your order system will seamlessly integrate with Google Sheets, allowing real-time order tracking and management.
