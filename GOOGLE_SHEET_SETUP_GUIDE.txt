HOW TO SET UP GOOGLE SHEETS FOR THE ICE SHOP ORDER SYSTEM

Step 1: Create a Google Sheet
1. Go to https://sheets.google.com
2. Click the "+" or "Blank" to create a new spreadsheet
3. Name your sheet (e.g., "Ice Shop Orders")

Step 2: Set up the Headers
Click on cell A1 and enter the following headers in Row 1:
- A1: Order ID
- B1: Customer ID
- C1: Customer Name
- D1: Customer Email
- E1: Customer Phone
- F1: Customer Address
- G1: Delivery Type
- H1: Items
- I1: Total
- J1: Order Date
- K1: Status

Step 3: Add some formatting (optional)
1. Select Row 1 (click the "1" on the left)
2. Make the headers bold (Ctrl+B or Cmd+B)
3. Optionally freeze the header row: View > Freeze > 1 row

Step 4: Get your Sheet ID
1. Look at the URL in your browser
2. Example URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz/edit#gid=0
3. Your Sheet ID is the long string between "/d/" and "/edit" (in this example: "1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz")
4. Save this Sheet ID for later use

Step 5: Share the Google Sheet
1. Click the "Share" button in the top right
2. Make sure the sheet is accessible to the Google Apps Script
3. You'll configure specific permissions in the next step

Step 6: Create the Google Apps Script
1. Go to https://script.google.com
2. Click "New Project"
3. Delete the default code in the editor
4. Copy and paste the complete Google Apps Script code from GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.txt
5. Replace 'YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE' with your actual Sheet ID
6. Save the project (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

Step 7: Deploy the Google Apps Script
1. Click the "Deploy" button (rocket ship icon)
2. Select "New deployment"
3. For "Deployment type", select "Web app"
4. Fill in the description (e.g., "Ice Shop Order Handler")
5. For "Execute as", choose "Me"
6. For "Who has access", choose "Anyone" (or "Anyone with Google account" for more security)
7. Click "Deploy"
8. You'll see an "Execution URL" - copy this URL and save it
9. This URL will replace 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE' in your script.js file

Step 8: Update your website
1. Open script.js in your ice_shop folder
2. Find the line: const GOOGLE_SHEETS_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE';
3. Replace 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE' with the Execution URL you copied in Step 7
4. Save the file

Step 9: Test the System
1. Place an order through your website
2. Check your Google Sheet - the new order should appear automatically
3. Log into the admin section (password: scoopadmin123)
4. Verify that orders show up in the admin panel
5. Test updating an order status to "completed" and verify it updates in the Google Sheet

Important Notes:
- For security, you may want to restrict access to your Google Apps Script if it's collecting sensitive data
- Google Apps Script has daily quotas, so be aware of usage limits
- You can view execution logs in the Apps Script dashboard to troubleshoot issues
- Make sure to keep your Sheet ID and script URL secure and do not share them publicly

Troubleshooting:
- If orders don't appear in the sheet, check the Apps Script execution logs for errors
- Ensure the Sheet ID in the Apps Script matches your Google Sheet
- Verify the permissions on both your Sheet and the deployed Apps Script
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors during form submission
